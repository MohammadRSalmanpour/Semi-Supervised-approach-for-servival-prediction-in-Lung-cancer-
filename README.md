Enhanced Lung Cancer Survival Prediction using Semi-Supervised Pseudo-Labeling and Learning from Diverse PET/CT Datasets

SERA Features Name indicated feature names used in the paper.
Semi_and_Supervised Classification tasks file is for all classificatin analyses.
The code includes Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Ensemble Voting (EV) linked with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In semi-supervised strategy, “pseudo labels” is used to train the model in a supervised way on the unlabeled data. Meanwhile, in Pseudo-labeling, a RandF classifier was employed to label the  H&NCa patients using training data, which were subsequently integrated into the training dataset for further analysis.

Survival Analysis Tasks file is for all survival prediction analyses.
The code includes 4 known survival prediction algorithms such as Fast Survival SVM (FSVM), Component-wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis (CWGB), and Random Survival Forest (RSF), COX Regression (COXR) linked with PCA were employed to survival analysis.
